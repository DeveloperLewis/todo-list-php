# Todo list app PHP
A todo list app that allows for user accounts to be created, which stores their todo list permanently
within a database. The project demonstrates create, read and delete operations, however it could be
expanded to update todo list messages, however since the messages are simple, it would be easier and faster
for them to delete them.
