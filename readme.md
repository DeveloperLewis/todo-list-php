# Todo list app PHP
A todo list app that allows for user accounts to be created, which stores their todo list permanently
within a database securely. 
## Installation
- git clone https://github.com/DeveloperLewis/todo-list-php.git
- composer install

- Enter the database.php class in the classes folder and change the username and password to match your database login.
- Enter the init.php and change the username and password to match your database login.
- The application will then create a database and the required tables so make sure the user of the database has the necessary permissions to do so.
- The application will run in XAMPP, or at least needs PHP 8, mariadb and apache to work. However xampp is pre-configured and easier to get running!
